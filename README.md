# AI Army 🤖

A collaborative development project leveraging AI assistants (Marmorc and others) to build innovative solutions.

## Overview

AI Army is an experimental project exploring how multiple AI assistants can collaborate effectively on software development tasks. This repository serves as a testing ground for AI-driven development workflows, best practices, and tooling.

## Project Goals

- **AI Collaboration**: Establish effective patterns for working with AI coding assistants
- **Code Quality**: Maintain high standards through AI-assisted code reviews and testing
- **Documentation**: Keep comprehensive, AI-friendly documentation
- **Experimentation**: Test new AI capabilities and development workflows

## Technology Stack

This project will evolve based on specific use cases, but generally focuses on:
- Modern web technologies
- Cloud-native architectures
- API integrations
- Automation and tooling

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js (version TBD based on project needs)
- Your preferred code editor with AI assistant integration

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/j2thex/ai_army.git
cd ai_army

# Install dependencies (when applicable)
npm install
```

## Development Workflow

This project uses AI assistants as primary development collaborators. See [.ai/rules.md](.ai/rules.md) for detailed guidelines on:
- How to work with Marmorc and other AI assistants
- Coding standards and conventions
- Commit message formats
- Testing requirements

## AI Collaboration

This project is designed to be developed primarily with AI assistance. We use:
- **Marmorc**: Primary AI development assistant
- **Structured prompts**: Clear, actionable requests
- **Iterative development**: Build, test, refine cycles
- **Documentation-first**: Keep AI context fresh and accurate

### Working with AI Assistants

1. **Be specific**: Provide clear requirements and context
2. **Review AI output**: Always verify generated code
3. **Iterate**: Use AI for rapid prototyping and refinement
4. **Document**: Keep AI rules and project docs up to date
